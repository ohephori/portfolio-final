                    <h2>Project Overview</h2>
                    
                    I was commissioned to create a design for Joe's music portfolio.
                    He asked for a simplistic, sleek, and dark design to compliment 
                    his music style with a short about and contact section. 

                    <h2>Project Role</h2>
                    
                    My role in this project was to be head designer for Joe's website.
                    I was to create a basic website to showcase his music using music
                    players along with other aspects.

                    <h2>The Problem & Goal for the Project</h2>
                    
                    The main problem for this project was making sleek music players that
                    matched the client's need for a sophisticated yet dark design and theme.


                    <br>

                   The main goal for this project was to make sure the clients aesthetic needs
                   were met while also properly showcasing their skills and work.

                    <h2>Digital Wireframe</h2>
                    
                    I started off laying out the pages main elements. Showing where each
                    photos, paragraph, header, copyright, music players etc. would be generally placed.

                <p>
                    <h2>Low-Fidelity Comp</h2>
                    
                    I brought in the main text for each section and reevaluated the positioning
                    of some aspects. I also placed in social media icons and copyright to make
                    sure spacing was correct and looking good.

                    <h2>High-Fidelity Comp</h2>
                    
                    With everything else in place I brought in the about image of Joe
                    as well as the album arts. With some more little tweaks to the positioning
                    the final design was ready. I showed Joe the high fidelity mockup and he was 
                    super satisfied with the product and had no more input.

                    <h2>Challenges & Takeaways</h2>

                    <p> Like mentioned before, a big challenge was creating the music players 
                        for Joe's site. I didn't find
                        too much else to be challenging with this project. The client was straightforward
                        with their wants and needs and ended up liking the initial style that I 
                        decided to go for.
                        <br>
                        I took away from this project new skills in design and a lot of good communication
                        skills after talking to and working with a new client. 
                    </p>

                    <h2>Project Conclusion</h2>

                    <p>In conclusion this project was by far one of my favorites to create. The client and I 
                        worked hand in hand to create the perfect site for his needs.
