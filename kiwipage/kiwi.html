                    <h2>Project Overview</h2>
                    
                     This project was a commissioned site made for KiwiBuilds. She wanted a website
                     to showcase her amazing reviews on her PC building skills. Eventually she plans
                     to transfer to a e-commerce website but for now she just wanted something
                     to get her name and brand out there.

                    <h2>Project Role</h2>
                    
                     My role in this project was as lead designer. I was to create a set of three mockups/designs 
                     that were comprehensive and responsive to desktop, tablet, and mobile screens.

                    <h2>The Problem & Goal for the Project</h2>
                    
                     The challenges for this project were not very vast. I had a surprisingly easy time creating this 
                     design for the client and for all iterations there were no design tweaks from the client.
                    
                    <br>
                    
                    The goal for this project was to create a bright and colorful website to help KiwiBuilds showcase 
                    their personality while also showcasing their expertise in their brand.

                    I began by laying out the main elements aimed for the webpage. Starting with desktop first. This 
                    step was to mainly make sure there was enough and adequate space for all the elements that 
                    KiwiBuilds wanted.

                    <h2>Low-Fidelity Comp</h2>
                    
                     The next low-fidelity comp iterated the main text and picture elements to ensure the aesthetic. 
                     Other item positions were tweaked slightly to incorporate the elements.

                    <h2>High-Fidelity Comp</h2>
                    
                    The final high-fidelity comp shows the final design in it's glory. With all colors and backgrounds
                    incorporated to show the final design style. This mockup was finished and compressed to be ready to 
                    hand off to a developer.

                    <h2>Challenges & Takeaways</h2>
                    
                    <p> 
                        After completing this site design I realized there were a few hurdles that I encountered.
                        One was making the site personal and professional at the same time. This feat meant that I had to keep 
                        things looking clean while also showing KiwiBuilds' personality through the site. The other 
                        hurdle was ofcourse, making it responsive and fit to different mobile screens. While I have
                        experience with this, it always seems to be a challenge to get each page looking how you want it to feel.

                    <br>
                        The biggest takeaway from this design was seeing how pleased KiwiBuilds was with the result. She not only loved 
                        the design and thought it matched her qualities, but thought that it was going to be a perfect realm to bring more customers in. 
                    </p>

                    <h2>Project Conclusion</h2>

                    <p> 

                    To conclude, this project resulted in a happy client and a beautiful website design! I worked hard
                    with the client to tweak and perfect her design to help it show personality and a fun playful environment,
                    while also using my UI/UX skills to keep the website looking clean, professional, and most of all aimed 
                    to please her audience.
