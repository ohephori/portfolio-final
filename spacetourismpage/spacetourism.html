                    <h2>Project Overview</h2>
                    
                    This website was an idea curated by me in order to showcase 
                    a study that I conducted while attending Metropolitan State 
                    University of Denver. I wanted to design and launch a website
                    that introduced and inticed people to the idea of space tourism
                    in our modern age.


                    <h2>Project Role</h2>
                    
                    I am the sole designer and developer behind this website and 
                    with that responsibility I have to come up with the content, design,
                    and code the entire project by hand.

                    <h2>The Problem & Goal for the Project</h2>
                    
                    The main problem behind this website is making sure the website
                    reels people in and gets them interested and excited enough to read 
                    the full study.
                    <br>
                    Which leads me to the goal of the website which is to create an immersive,
                    interesting, and eye popping website that will attract it's users and get them
                    to keep reading!

                    <h2>Digital Wireframe</h2>
                    
                    I started off laying out the pages main elements. Showing where each
                    photo, paragraph, header, copyright, etc. would be generally placed.

                    <h2>Low-Fidelity Comp</h2>
                    
                    I brought in the main headers for text and black background to represent the
                    websites main final elements. I did this to test and play with different 
                    fonts, styles, colors, etc. before moving on to the high-fidelity mockup
                    where the text and colors would stay the same. 
                    </p>

                    <h2>High-Fidelity Comp</h2>
                    
                    With everything else in place, I brought in the images that I've chosen for the site.
                     Alongside this, I also incorporated the navigation at the top. To round off
                     this mockup design I centered and adjusted the elements using a grid so when
                     I started coding I would be able to do so with straightforward ease.

                    <h2>Challenges & Takeaways</h2>

                    <p> The main challenges were making sure the theme was sleek yet space themed. Giving it a sophisticated look
                        and feel while also taking you through the cosmos. I found that using the color
                        in mostly the background and photos gave the site it's spark that it needed.
                        <br>
                        I tookaway from this project a sense of acomplishment and a whole lot of 
                        newfound design and coding knowledge. Since this was my first ever project
                        on my own, I spent a lot of the process learning but it has left me with
                        extreme confidence in design, HTML and CSS.
                    </p>

                    <h2>Project Conclusion</h2>

                    <p>I was able to create a sleek, stunningly designed website that could attract
                        anyone to the idea of space tourism. With my knowledge in the design process,
                        HTML, and CSS I curated a website from start to finish from scratch as my first 
                        ever web developement project.
