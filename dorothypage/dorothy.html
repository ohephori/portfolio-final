                    <h2>Project Overview</h2>
                    
                    Dorothy DeLong is a feminist photographer that reached out to me to create a web design for her photography portfolio. Dorothy also wanted to make it easy for magazines and museums to contact her with requests to feature her work.

                    <h2>Project Role</h2>
                    
                    As the sole designer on this project, I worked closely with Dorothy to understand her goals for the website and implement them into a polished final design.

                    <h2>The Problem & Goal for the Project</h2>
                    
                    Dorothy DeLong travels across the country to take photographs of women doing extraordinary things. She was using a Facebook page to share her photos, but as her work became more popular, she needed a more professional platform to share with galleries and magazines.
                    <br>
                    At the end of the project, Dorothy will have a one-page website design to showcase her work and add new photos as she builds her portfolio. It will include space to provide her artist’s statement, a photo of herself, and an easy way for interested parties to contact her to display or use her work.

                    <h2>Digital Wireframe</h2>
                    
                    I brought the sketch into Figma to create the design in a digital form. I laid
                    out the basic wireframe with spots for content and text. This allowed me to 
                    lay out the design and mess with positioning until i got everything in it's 
                    final placement and ready to input more information.

                    <h2>Low-Fidelity Comp</h2>
                    
                    I brought the typefaces into the wireframe to check them within the context of the layout.
                    This is where I played around with the logos and placement of text. Also the 
                    strength of the shades of colors and placement of logo and navigation.

                    With everything else in place, I brought in the images that Dorothy provided.
                    This is where the magic came to life. I finalized the font styles, color pallete, photo
                    placement and iconography.

                    <h2>Challenges & Takeaways</h2>

                    <p> Creating this one-page portfolio design for Dorothy DeLong allowed me to seek current design trends to achieve design goals and further improve my skills with software (specifically Figma) to create a high-fidelity design.  While I didn’t directly work with a development team, I did ensure that all of the design files and assets were clearly labeled and ready for use in coding the website.
                        <br>
                    After showing the final design to Dorothy, she decided to add some additional photos and another social media platform link. The flexible layout for the portfolio section made adding extra photos easy to do and will allow Dorothy to modify her portfolio in the future as well.</p>

                    <h2>Project Conclusion</h2>

                    <p> I was able to create a clean, modern design for Dorothy DeLong to showcase her feminist photography. The one-page website focuses on her work, information about the artist, and contact information. Because Dorothy wants to keep adding and changing out the images included in the portfolio section, I made sure the design would allow for additional photos to fit seamlessly into the layout.
                    <br>
                    Dorothy was provided the final design, which included colors codes, fonts, and exported assets to make coding the design easier for the developer. </p>
